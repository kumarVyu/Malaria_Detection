# Malaria_Detection  
Automated detection of malaria-infected vs. uninfected blood cell images using deep learning.

## 📋 Project Overview  
This repository implements a convolutional neural-network (CNN)-based image classification pipeline to distinguish between malaria-infected and non-infected blood cell images. It includes Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation and visualization.

## 💡 Key Features  
- Data loading and preprocessing of the blood-cell image dataset.  
- Building and training a deep CNN model for classification of infected vs. uninfected cells.  
- Performance evaluation with metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc) and visualizations.  
- Two separate notebooks (`malaria_Detection (1).ipynb`, `malaria_Detection_2.ipynb`) providing experiments with different model architectures / hyperparameters.

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)  
- TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch) for the deep-learning model  
- Standard image-processing libraries (e.g. OpenCV, PIL) & data-science stack (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)  
- Dataset: Single-cell blood-smear images labeled as “Infected” / “Uninfected”

## 🚀 Usage  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
